## Note: This was my first Java project I worked on, please don't let the quality of this code reflect my skill as a developer. Thank you :)

Uses the Hypixel API to intelligently detect if user accounts have been compromised.

Currently sends an email to the user if the account is detected to be hacked.
Contains language checks mainly, more checking are needed.
Deprecated project, no longer in development unless needed.
